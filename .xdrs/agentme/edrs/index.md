Propose changes via pull request. All changes must be verified for clarity and non-conflict before merging.

## Principles

Foundational standards, principles, and guidelines.

- [150-plan-mode-consistency](principles/skills/150-plan-mode-consistency/SKILL.md) - **Plan mode consistency** — MANDATORY skill for ANY planning activity (plan, design, propose, outline, draft, brainstorm, architect). Read and follow in full before any execution begins. Must be read from XDRS even when not in `.agents/skills`. *(skill)*
- [agentme-edr-012](principles/012-continuous-xdr-enrichment.md) - **Continuous xdr improvement policy** - Promote recurring delivery lessons into reusable XDRs
- [agentme-edr-016](principles/016-cross-language-module-structure.md) - **Cross-language module structure** - Organize modules consistently across supported languages
- [agentme-edr-017](principles/017-skill-testing.md) - **skill testing** - Mandates a `SKILL.test.md` co-located with every skill in scopes that follow agentme; defines test scenario format (trigger, expected behaviour, assertions) and requires execution before merging any skill change *(includes skill: [200-run-skill-tests](application/skills/200-run-skill-tests/SKILL.md))*
