# agentme-edr-policy-104: CLI tool standards

## Context and Problem Statement

CLI projects often mix command parsing, business logic, config loading, and output formatting in one entry point, making them hard to reuse as libraries and inconsistent to operate.

What structure and interface rules should distributable CLI tools follow so they remain discoverable, scriptable, and reusable outside the command line?

## Decision Outcome

**Use a command-oriented CLI as a thin adapter over a standalone library, with CLI-owned config discovery, mandatory help/version/verbose flags, and consistent progress and exit behavior.**

This keeps the user-facing command predictable while preserving a clean library API for embedding, testing, and automation.

### Details

#### CLI command surface

- CLI tools SHOULD default to the format `[tool] [command] [options] [arguments]`.
- Example: `filedist extract --packages=test mydir`
- A single-action tool MAY omit `[command]` only when adding a subcommand would be artificial and there is no meaningful action split.
- Every CLI tool MUST expose:
  - `--help` on the root command
  - `--version` on the root command
  - `--verbose` on the root command and on subcommands when flags are parsed per command
- Root `--help` output MUST list all available commands, key options, and usage examples. Command-specific help MUST describe that command's arguments and options.

#### CLI to application separation

- Structure the software as `cli -> app` — the CLI adapter delegates to the application layer, following [agentme-edr-126](126-pragmatic-hexagonal-architecture.md). For unit testing the application layer and mocking outbound connectors, follow [agentme-edr-126 rule `09`](126-pragmatic-hexagonal-architecture.md#09-unit-testing-and-mocking-strategy).
- The CLI layer MUST only parse arguments, load config, call the application layer, and format output.
- Domain logic MUST live in the application layer and be usable without CLI globals such as `argv`, `stdout`, or process exit handlers.
- Every feature available through the CLI MUST also be available through the application API.
- Organize the application layer by action so the mapping stays direct and obvious.
  - `extract` command -> `app/extract(...)`
  - `validate` command -> `app/validate(...)`
- Avoid one generic `run()` entry point that hides action-specific contracts behind switches or string commands.

#### Application API shape

- Each CLI action SHOULD map to a dedicated exported application function with typed inputs and outputs appropriate for the language.
- Application APIs SHOULD accept in-memory options objects or typed parameters, not require config files or environment variables unless application-level config-file support is an explicit requirement.
- The CLI layer is responsible for translating flags, positional arguments, and config-file contents into application inputs.
- The application layer SHOULD return explicit results and errors so the CLI can decide what to print and which exit code to use.

#### Configuration

- Prefer flags and positional arguments for simple inputs.
- When configuration becomes long, nested, or repetitive, use a YAML config file instead of pushing all values into flags. See [agentme-edr-305](../platform/305-environment-variable-configuration.md) for when `.env` values should be referenced from within that file.
- By default, config-file discovery and loading MUST happen in the CLI layer, not in the application layer.
- When a config file is supported, the CLI MUST try to load a YAML file from `[cwd]/[tool-name].yml` by default.
- The CLI MUST also support an explicit config path flag such as `--config`.
- The application layer MUST NOT depend on the presence of the config file; it SHOULD receive parsed configuration values from the CLI layer.
- The application layer MAY load or parse config files only when that behavior is an explicit requirement of the application contract for non-CLI consumers as well.

#### Output and progress

- Standard output MUST show a start message when work begins and a result message when work completes successfully.
- When processing is long-running or multi-stage, print concise intermediate progress messages.
- `--verbose` MUST reveal more internal detail about what the tool is doing without changing the meaning of the command result.
- Default output SHOULD stay concise and readable for humans.
- Errors SHOULD be written to standard error with an actionable message. Stack traces or raw internal errors SHOULD stay hidden by default and MAY be shown in verbose mode.

#### Exit behavior

- Exit with `0` only when the requested action completed successfully.
- Exit with `1` when the requested action could not be completed.
- The application layer SHOULD surface failure as return values, result objects, or language-idiomatic errors; the CLI is responsible for converting that outcome into user-facing messages and process exit codes.

#### Documentation

- `README.md` MUST include at least 4 CLI usage examples.
- `README.md` MUST include at least 2 application API examples for the same operation also available through the CLI.
- If the tool supports config files, at least 1 README example SHOULD show config-file usage.
- Examples MUST use the public command and public application API, not internal modules or private files.

#### Distribution and versioning

- The implementation language is project-dependent, but the packaging and entry-point strategy MUST match how users are expected to run the tool.
- Choose language tooling that stays compatible with ecosystem launchers such as `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, `uvx`, or equivalent distribution commands for that ecosystem.
- `--version` MUST print the same version declared in the published package or release artifact metadata.
- Do not hard-code a second version string that can drift from the published package version.
- Language-specific project structure and packaging rules still apply and SHOULD be combined with this XDR, especially [agentme-edr-101](101-javascript-project-tooling.md), [agentme-edr-102](102-golang-project-tooling.md), and [agentme-edr-103](103-python-project-tooling.md).

## Considered Options

* (REJECTED) **Ad hoc CLIs with embedded business logic** - Keep parsing, processing, config loading, and output formatting inside a single entry point.
  * Reason: Makes the tool hard to test, hard to reuse programmatically, and inconsistent across commands.
* (CHOSEN) **Thin CLI adapter over action-oriented application APIs** - Keep the CLI responsible for user interaction and the application layer responsible for the actual behavior.
  * Reason: Preserves a clean programmatic API, keeps command behavior discoverable, and makes the CLI-to-application mapping easy to maintain.
