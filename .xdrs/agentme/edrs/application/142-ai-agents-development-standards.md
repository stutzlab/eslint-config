# agentme-edr-policy-142: AI agents development standards

## Context and Problem Statement

AI applications often need to give LLMs the ability to autonomously choose and invoke tools to accomplish tasks. Without standardized structural patterns for agent design, projects end up with incompatible approaches to framework selection, sandbox setup, state management, naming, composition, and system prompts.

Which framework should be used for building agents, how should agents be sandboxed, named, composed, and how should their system prompts be structured?

## Decision Outcome

**Use the deepagents framework for all agent implementations where an LLM autonomously decides which tools to call and when to stop.**

### Conceptual model

An **Agent** is an LLM-based flow driven by a tool-invocation loop that the LLM itself plans and executes. The LLM decides which tools to call and when to stop. The agent follows a perceive → plan → act → observe cycle autonomously until it reaches a terminal state.

### Details

#### 01-agent-framework

All agent implementations MUST use the **deepagents** framework.

- Use deepagents whenever the LLM needs to autonomously select and invoke tools to accomplish a task.
- The agent MUST follow the perceive → plan → act → observe cycle where the LLM observes tool outputs and decides the next action.
- All LLM calls within agents MUST follow [agentme-edr-141](141-ai-llm-development-standards.md) for LangChain configuration and observability.

**When to use agents vs workflows:**

- Use an **agent** when the LLM should autonomously decide the sequence of tool calls based on runtime observations.
- Use a **workflow** when the execution path is predefined in code, even if individual nodes involve LLM calls or agent subgraphs.
- When in doubt, prefer workflows (explicit control flow) over agents (autonomous control flow) for maintainability and predictability.

#### 02-local-sandbox

When an agent requires a **local sandbox** — an isolated environment where the agent can read files, glob-search directories, and execute shell commands — use the **[deepagents](https://github.com/deepagents/deepagents) framework** to provide that sandbox.

**When to apply this rule:**

Use deepagents sandbox whenever ANY of the following is true:
- The agent needs to execute shell commands or scripts in a controlled environment.
- The agent needs to list, read, or search files across multiple directories at runtime.
- The agent operates on user-supplied or generated file trees that MUST NOT escape a sandboxed boundary.

**Integration requirements:**

- The sandbox MUST be initialized with `virtual_mode=True` to prevent the agent from reading or writing files outside the mounted workspace. Omitting this flag allows the agent unrestricted host filesystem access, which is a security violation.
- Initialize the sandbox at the start of the agent run and shut it down in the same `try/finally` block.
- Pass the sandbox handle into the agent's state so all tool calls share the same sandbox instance.
- If the host-side code needs to pass files into the sandbox (e.g. generated config or input data), create a temporary directory with `tempfile.mkdtemp()`, write the files there, and mount it into the sandbox. Clean it up in the `finally` block.
- Replace hand-rolled `read_file`, `search_files`, and `grep_file` tool implementations with the equivalent tools provided by deepagents.

**Example:**

```python
import tempfile
from deepagents import Sandbox

def run_file_analysis_agent(input_files: List[Path]) -> AnalysisResult:
    tmp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        # Copy input files to temp directory
        for f in input_files:
            shutil.copy(f, tmp_dir)
        
        # Initialize sandbox with mounted directory
        sandbox = Sandbox(mount_paths={tmp_dir: "/workspace"}, virtual_mode=True)
        
        # Run agent with sandbox
        agent = FileAnalysisAgent(sandbox=sandbox)
        result = agent.run()
        
        return result
    finally:
        sandbox.shutdown()
        shutil.rmtree(tmp_dir)
```

#### 03-agent-state-management

**State type naming:**

- Agent state types MUST end with `_agent_state` suffix (e.g., `file_analyzer_agent_state`)
- Follow [agentme-edr-144](144-ai-workflow-development-standards.md) rule `11-state-type-conventions` when agents are used as workflow nodes

#### 04-agent-naming-conventions

Agent class names MUST follow the pattern `<Purpose>Agent` where `<Purpose>` describes what the agent does:

**Good names:**
- `FileAnalyzerAgent` — analyzes files
- `CodeReviewerAgent` — reviews code
- `DataExtractorAgent` — extracts data from documents

**Bad names (FORBIDDEN):**
- `Agent` (too generic)
- `MainAgent` (not descriptive)
- `MyAgent` (not descriptive)
- `Agent1` (numbered, not semantic)

When agents are used as nodes in workflows, the node name MUST use the `_agent` suffix per [agentme-edr-144](144-ai-workflow-development-standards.md) rule `09-node-naming-conventions`.

#### 05-agent-composition

When multiple agents are needed, one of these composition patterns MUST be chosen:

- **Single agent with multiple tools:** Use when tools share a common goal and context (e.g., a code analysis agent with `read_file`, `search_code`, and `analyze_pattern` tools).
- **Multiple agents as workflow nodes:** Use when agents have distinct responsibilities and outputs that feed into each other. Orchestrate them using LangGraph per [agentme-edr-144](144-ai-workflow-development-standards.md).
- Nested agent loops (agent calling agent autonomously) MUST NOT be created. Use workflows for multi-agent orchestration.

**Decision criteria:**

| Pattern | When to use |
|---|---|
| Single agent + tools | All tools serve the same goal; agent completes in one session |
| Multiple workflow-orchestrated agents | Each agent has a distinct goal; outputs flow between agents; deterministic sequencing needed |
| Nested agents (FORBIDDEN) | MUST NOT use nested agents; MUST use workflow orchestration instead |

#### 06-agent-system-prompt-structure

Every agent system prompt MUST follow this XML-section template. Sections MUST appear in this order. Required sections MUST be present; optional sections may be omitted when they genuinely do not apply; MUST NOT be reordered.

```xml
[specific task description to the agent. if not defined use the default prompt "Execute your objective taking into consideration the inputs provided and all the sections described below"]

<OBJECTIVE>
[A one or two-sentence summary of the agent's main deliverable.
e.g.: Split the incoming file list into logical batches for parallel processing.]
</OBJECTIVE>

<AGENT_ROLE>
[Defines who the agent is, its area of expertise, and its core persona.
If running inside a workflow, define exactly which node in WORKFLOW_CONTEXT this agent corresponds to.
e.g.: You are the batch_planning_agent (see WORKFLOW_CONTEXT). You are an expert at partitioning large file sets into balanced, directory-aware batches.]
</AGENT_ROLE>

<INPUT>
[All inputs for this agent invocation. For standalone agents: list only the agent-specific inputs. For workflow agents: list workflow-level inputs shared across all agents first, then agent-specific inputs such as judge outcomes, counters, or intermediate results from upstream nodes.]
</INPUT>

<!-- Optional: include when the agent follows a non-trivial sequence of steps -->
<STEPS>
[Numbered list or chronological steps detailing how the agent should process an incoming request.
e.g.:
1. Analyse the file list and group files by directory.
2. Assign files to batches respecting the size constraints.
3. Emit the JSON output described in OUTPUT_FORMAT.]
</STEPS>

<!-- Optional: include when tool use needs explicit guidance -->
<TOOL_GUIDANCE>
[Explicit instructions on when and how to use external tools, preventing the agent from guessing or using the wrong sequence.
e.g.: Do not call any tools. All reasoning is done in-context using the INPUT fields only.]
</TOOL_GUIDANCE>

<!-- Optional: include when hard constraints need to be stated explicitly -->
<GUARDRAILS>
[Hard, non-negotiable constraints the agent must never violate.
All constraints MUST use mandatory language: MUST, MUST NOT, NEVER, ALWAYS, SHALL, SHALL NOT.
e.g.: NEVER create batches with fewer than 5 or more than 20 files. NEVER split files from the same directory across different batches unless unavoidable.]
</GUARDRAILS>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
[A templated example or JSON schema specifying exactly how the final response should look.
When multiple output formats are possible, use mandatory language (MUST, ALWAYS, NEVER) to specify exactly which format to use and exclude the others.
e.g.: Respond with a JSON object matching this schema: ... ALWAYS return valid JSON. NEVER include prose outside the JSON block.]
</OUTPUT_FORMAT>

<!-- Workflow-only: omit this section for standalone (non-workflow) agents -->
<WORKFLOW_CONTEXT>
[A detailed prose or diagram description of the overall workflow graph so the agent understands its role within the larger flow. Reference the specific node name that maps to this agent. Include enough detail about upstream and downstream nodes so the agent can reason about its context.]
</WORKFLOW_CONTEXT>

<SYSTEM_CONTEXT>
The current date is [today in YYYY-MM-DD format].
The current OS is: [operating system name].
</SYSTEM_CONTEXT>
```

**Rules:**

| Section | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `<SYSTEM_CONTEXT>` | Optional | Runtime environment context injected at invocation time (e.g., current date in YYYY-MM-DD, OS). Include whenever the agent may need temporal or environment awareness. Time MUST NOT be included — it changes every second and breaks prompt caching. |
| `<OBJECTIVE>` | Required | One or two sentences summarising the agent's main deliverable. |
| `<AGENT_ROLE>` | Required | Agent persona and expertise. When inside a workflow, MUST reference its node name from `<WORKFLOW_CONTEXT>`. |
| `<INPUT>` | Required | List ALL inputs. For workflow agents: workflow-level inputs first, then agent-specific inputs. |
| `<STEPS>` | Optional | Include when the agent follows a non-trivial numbered sequence of steps. |
| `<TOOL_GUIDANCE>` | Optional | Include when tool use order or conditions need explicit direction. |
| `<GUARDRAILS>` | Optional | Hard constraints that must never be violated. All constraint statements MUST use mandatory language: MUST, MUST NOT, NEVER, ALWAYS, SHALL, SHALL NOT. |
| `<OUTPUT_FORMAT>` | Required | MUST include a concrete schema or templated example; do not leave it vague. When multiple output formats are possible, MUST use mandatory language to specify exactly which one to use and explicitly exclude the others. |
| `<WORKFLOW_CONTEXT>` | Conditional | MUST be omitted for standalone agents. MUST be present when the agent runs as a node inside a LangGraph workflow. |

**Formatting rules:**

- MUST use XML tags to delimit every section.
- The content of each section MUST start on the line immediately after the opening tag — MUST NOT be inline with it.
- Each closing tag MUST be followed by a blank line before the next opening tag, so sections are visually separated.

```xml
<OBJECTIVE>
Produce a plan for the current batch of files.
</OBJECTIVE>

<AGENT_ROLE>
You are the batch_plan_agent.
</AGENT_ROLE>
```

#### 07-agent-output-format

The format of an agent's final output MUST be chosen based on who or what consumes it:

| Consumer | Required format |
|---|---|
| Code (workflow node, downstream function, API caller) | JSON object matching a declared schema |
| Human (user-facing summary, review comment, prose report) | Natural language; JSON is NOT required |

**When output is consumed by code:**

- The agent's `<OUTPUT_FORMAT>` system prompt section MUST specify a JSON schema or a concrete typed example.
- The `<OUTPUT_FORMAT>` section MUST include the instruction: `ALWAYS return valid JSON. NEVER include prose outside the JSON block.`
- The corresponding Python return type MUST be a typed dataclass or Pydantic model that mirrors the schema, not a plain `dict` or `str`.
- The caller MUST parse and validate the JSON against the declared type before passing it downstream.

**Example — code-consumed agent output:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List
import json

@dataclass
class FileAnalysisResult:
    status: str          # "success" | "failure"
    files_found: int
    issues: List[str]

# System prompt OUTPUT_FORMAT section:
# <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
# Respond with a JSON object matching this schema:
# {
#   "status": "success" | "failure",
#   "files_found": <integer>,
#   "issues": ["<string>", ...],
#   "summary": "summary of the work performed. max 30 words",
# }
# ALWAYS return valid JSON. NEVER include prose outside the JSON block.
# </OUTPUT_FORMAT>

def parse_agent_output(raw: str) -> FileAnalysisResult:
    data = json.loads(raw)
    return FileAnalysisResult(**data)
```

**When output is consumed by a human:**

- Natural language is correct and preferred.
- Do NOT wrap prose in JSON — it adds noise without value.
- The `<OUTPUT_FORMAT>` section MUST still describe the expected structure (e.g., a list of findings, a summary paragraph) using a prose template.
